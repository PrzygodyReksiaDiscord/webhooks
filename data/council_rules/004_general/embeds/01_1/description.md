1a. The Council consists of eleven users, one of whom serves as the Chairman of the Council. 
1b. The duties of the Chairman include: organizing and overseeing the Council’s work. Each Chairman reserves the right to determine how they fulfill this role. Additionally, the Chairman may assist in promoting and preparing various server projects (e.g., by writing announcements and creating events). 
1c. The Council holds meetings in dedicated channels. These channels are also accessible to users who boost the server, although they do not have voting rights. 
1d. The Council’s responsibilities include: supporting the Administration in server development as well as initiating projects regarding activation of community. 
1e. Assistance from Council members in helping the Administration maintain order on the server is welcome. However, Council members may only do so by: 
	a) reporting users who break the rules directly to the administration via private messages (to avoid spamming in Council channels); 
	b) proposing reforms to the penalty system and other documents or procedures.
