## 🇺🇸 Sewers rules
1. On the <#1389709259708563556> (#sewers) forum, you can create threads for casual activities  except for:
  - Neverending Story-like games - the <#909151292780339240> channel is designated for these (if you wish to reactivate it, please notify the Staff)
  - quizzes conducted on voice channels - the <#981501885678764072> channel is dedicated for their organizers
  - Discord Activities - these do not yet work in threads, so they should be played in <#909046594421293076> or in the text chats of voice channels for now
  - bracket polls regarding Aidem Media games or the Adventures of Reksio fandom - these may receive their own channel (please consult the Staff)
  - bracket polls composed of 3 or fewer votes - as they are too short for their own thread, they should be held in <#1416854032349134969> (#polls)
  Creating game projects and then developing them together with others is also allowed.
2. Before starting a new thread, check for existing similar ones.
3. In your first message, explain the rules of your activity. You can also attach a graphic (a file or link) - it will be displayed in the thread list view.
4. Add appropriate tags to your post:
- **🧌 spam** - a space for mass posting
- **🥳 zabawa/game** or **🎙️ zabawa vc/vc game** - a text or voice game based on the rules specified by its author
- **🧩 łamigłówka/puzzle** - solving an ARG-style puzzle together
- **🏅 konkurs/competition** - an activity aimed at determining the winner(s)
- **🗳️ plebiscyt/bracket** - a series of votes comparing certain things (usually to choose the best one)
- **🎭 roleplay** - a game based on playing a role; includes text-based role-playing games played on this server or another (and only discussed here)
