<@788821057452245012> <:snejk:1003782945464668160> - I am the founder of Adventures of Reksio Discord. This community means a lot to me, so I'm trying to give it my best - by organizing various activities, complaining occasionally <:stary_kretes:909827784849887252>, or just making sure everything is ok. My priority is helping others. I'm here to listen, DM me or ping me with anything, whenever you need it, and you will always get an answer <:ahoj:909044920155779084>.

<@718495049989488720> <:kretoff:1003782998539382864> - I am the administrator who has been building this server almost from scratch. That's why Newt entrusted me the owner position. Despite my studies and other interests, I try to keep up to date with most of the channels (don't be surprised if I suddenly start catching up on news from a few days ago, which looks like I'm texting with myself) to keep order. <:miaul:909063516231729152> I am always willing to help with server issues, fandom gatherings or Rex games themselves.

<@450069032968650762> <:duma:909045036233138206> - being (among) the top 6 "Rex workshop" members, I've been assigned to fight tech issues. I'm also committed to helping in administrative decisions based on my long (ðŸ‘´) experience with Reksio-themed servers. Just like kretonpodziemny, I'm not always up to date with all the channels, so you can see me mass-replying to old messages. Oh, I moderate our dear Rex Forum too.
