<@788821057452245012> <:snejk:1003782945464668160> - I am the founder of this Rex Adventures Discord. I am responsible here for keeping order, complaining about everything and coming up with various entertainment to bring in some activity. You can ask me a question and you will always get an answer.

<@718495049989488720> <:kretoff:1003782998539382864> - I am the administrator who has been building this server almost from scratch. That's why Newt entrusted me the owner position. Despite my studies and other interests, I try to keep up to date with all channels (don't be surprised if I suddenly start catching up on news from a few days ago, which looks like I'm texting with myself) to keep order. <:miaul:909063516231729152> I am always willing to help with server issues, fandom gatherings or Rex games themselves.

<@450069032968650762> <:duma:909045036233138206> - being (among) the top 6 "Rex workshop" members, I've been assigned to fight tech issues. I'm also committed to helping in administrative decisions based on my long (ðŸ‘´) experience with Reksio-themed servers. Just like kretonpodziemny, I'm not always up to date with all the channels, so you can see me mass-replying to old messages. Oh, I moderate our dear Rex Forum too.
