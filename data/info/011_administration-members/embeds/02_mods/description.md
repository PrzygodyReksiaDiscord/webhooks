<@349655453493624846> <:uwu:909044715364708373> - I am the newest moderator. I used to be the chairwoman of the Server Council. On the server and in our fandom I participate in almost every possible thing, so I got nothing specific that is my pride and joy. <:kisne:909045357030297613> You may remember me from my participation in Fedor's radio drama, hear my voice in Sermageddon or see my name in the end credits of the Serena's Reksio English AI dubing project. <:love_molly:909045444791926794> I also organized and took part in many server activities. <:zabba:909085254264975390> I am usually active almost all the time, so if something is happening or you just want to talk my dms are always open for you. <:przytulanie:909063765604061194>
