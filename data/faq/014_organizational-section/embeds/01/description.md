**1. There are so many channels! How do I figure out which one is for what?** Don't worry, each channel has an appropriate description at the top that will tell you what topics should be brought up. You can also check the all channel’s description on <#1180897754327826503>. If you want to make sure a given topic can be brought up on a certain channel, just ask (on a general channel, in private or on <#909039074059370527>).
**2. What types of channels are in each category?** You can check it out on the <#1180897754327826503> channel. 
**3. The topic that I want to start a conversation about does not match any of the channel descriptions. What can I do?** Use general channels that do not have a strictly defined topic, such as <#909041188810661898> or <#1173378559037943958>. Server games and less substantive discussions should take place on the <#909046498166186036> channel. Controversial topics can be discussed only on <#909046538091778048>. 
If you want to discuss a longer topic (so that it is not a one-off conversation), you can create a so-called thread. To create one, just click on the inclined thread spool icon on the top right and then click on the “Create” button. Remember to create new threads carefully and to keep them thematically related to the channel to which they belong (or to create them in general channels in the absence of more closely related ones). Example: you can create a thread for walkthroughs of Reksio games on the <#909041092895326248> channel and a thread about mushroom picking on <#909041188810661898>.
