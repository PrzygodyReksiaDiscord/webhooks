**8. What is this ‚Äúinstallation dir‚Äù? And what about `VirtualStore`?** The installation directory is the place where game files from the game disk are copied to when the game is installed (it is not the game disk). The directory is chosen in the installation wizard - it‚Äôs a good idea to remember it.
If you don‚Äôt know the installation dir, it can still be found by locating the shortcut to the game, right-clicking it and:
- (for a Desktop shortcut) choosing ‚ÄúOpen file location‚Äù,
- (for a Start Menu shortcut) choosing ‚ÄúMore‚Äù ü°í ‚ÄúOpen file location‚Äù and then right-clicking the icon in the newly opened window and choosing ‚ÄúOpen file location‚Äù again.
When there is no shortcut, you can make a guess: the game is most likely installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\AidemMedia` or `C:\Program Files\AidemMedia`. The installation directory is named after the game (e.g. `Reksio Piraci`).
VirtualStore is a place where all changes to the game files (e.g. saves) are stored if the game has been installed in `Program Files` and is not run as administrator. The folder associated with a particular game can be found in `%LocalAppData%\VirtualStore` ü°í `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)` ü°í `AidemMedia`.
