12. More bothersome behavior may result in a ban, the reasons and duration of which the user (if contact with him does not pose a threat to the server) and the community will be notified. Bans and mutes are imposed in accordance with the tariff available [below](<https://discord.com/channels/822931925618524240/1180897656663453840/1180906811881160716>).

13. Multiaccounts are allowed only with the administators' permission. Unreported multiaccounts will be kicked out from the server, and the main account will be penalized with warn or ban.

To prevent multiaccounts, users are verified using a bot (<@703886990948565003>). If administrators suspect someone has an unreported multiaccount, they can take the verification back. Re-verification is automatic and can be done using the panel on <#1318222020520968342>.
