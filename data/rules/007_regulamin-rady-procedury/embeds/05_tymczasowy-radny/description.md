For the purposes of discussing a specific matter, the Staff may temporarily grant selected individuals the role of Temporary Councilor (@Tymczasowy Radny). This role is withdrawn after the matter is discussed or when the need for consultation with the designated individuals ceases. As a Temporary Councilor is not a formal member of the Council, their only responsibility is to participate in discussions regarding the matter that prompted the Staff to grant them the access to the Council channels.
