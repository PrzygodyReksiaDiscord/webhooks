1. Severe hate/threats - bans from 2 weeks (the lowest penalty may also be a mute) to a year (depending on the accumulation).
2. Raids (and analogical acting alone) - bans for about a month or longer, if more dangerous.
3. Inappropriate content - warns, mutes, bans for a week/two, unless accumulated - then gradually extended.
4. Hacker vandalism and the most serious abuse of administrative powers - longer bans, even for many years.
5. If someone is convicted by a final judgment for a crime against a fandom member, he may receive a mute or ban no longer that the punishment ordered by the court.
6. The rest - warns, mutes, kicks, bans up to a month (unless accumulation, then gradually extended).
7. In case of a gross or persistent violation of the server rules by an administration member, their temporary or permanent degradation is possible.
8. Time spent voluntarily outside the server during the mute is treated as an alternative form of serving the punishment.
9. There are no perm bans for accounts that are not bots or sock puppet accounts made by other users, except for the hardest crimes (vide point 5). This guarantee applies only to people who proved themselves with at least some form of positive contribution to the server. Accounts, whose only purpose is instigating arguments, insulting other users or trolling can be banned permanently.
10. In exceptional cases, it is possible to be muted until further notice, if the user has been punished very often or very severely, and still causes problems by breaking the server rules. These mutes may be preceded by a temporary ban.
11. First offenses punishable as mildly as possible.
12. Frequent entering and exiting the server or changing the main account on the server too often (even despite the statutory notification of this intention to administration) may result in a warning, manual verification being postponed (only for recently created accounts) or, in extreme cases, a ban.
