8. Advertisement posting does not require administrator permission. It is only necessary for the advertisement to not contradict our rules. Artistic commissions shall be offered on art-related channels and threads, buying/selling Aidem Media games should be done in <#1415121141885829212>, and all the other ads should be posted within an appropriate thread on <#1389709259708563556>.

9. Games, contests and RPGs can be organized on the <#1389709259708563556> channel according to its rules. Listed activities may be also held outside <#1389709259708563556> with permission from the Staff.

10. By posting your own Rex arts or creating Rex emotes for this server, you are consenting to copying and distributing them for use by the fandom.

11. Users who break the rules may be warned, kicked, or muted (using Timeout / the <@&909039818728673360> role) which makes them unable to write for a period specified by the administration. Muted users can apply for mediation taking place in the archived channel <#914203503218548757> (dungeons). A milder form of muting is <@&1071088633366458470> (quarantine), which covers most channels not directly related to the server's topic.

12. More bothersome behavior may result in a ban, the reasons and duration of which the user (if contact with him does not pose a threat to the server) and the community will be notified. Bans and mutes are imposed in accordance with the tariff available [below](<https://discord.com/channels/822931925618524240/1180897656663453840/1180906811881160716>). Transferring content and messages from banned users to the server is only permitted with the consent of the administration. 

13. Multiaccounts are allowed only with the administators' permission. Unreported multiaccounts will be kicked out from the server, and the main account will be penalized with warn or ban. A user can replace their account on the server after reporting this intention to the administators, however this option shouldn't be used too often. To prevent multiaccounts, users are verified using a bot (<@703886990948565003>). If administrators suspect someone has an unreported multiaccount, they can take the verification back. Re-verification is automatic and can be done using the panel on <#1318222020520968342>.

14. Users are being warned on <#909039706342326304>. If you don't agree with a warn, you can make a complaint on <#909039074059370527>.
