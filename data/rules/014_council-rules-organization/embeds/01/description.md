**2.1.** The Council has a dedicated space (the **ðŸ“œ Gabinety Rady ðŸ“œ** category) which consists of the following channels: [**`# rada-serwera`**](https://discord.com/channels/822931925618524240/942534739846365214) (#server-council), [**`# sala-kolumnowa`**](https://discord.com/channels/822931925618524240/1173365836484976690) (#column-chamber), [**`ðŸ”Š Sala Plenarna`**](https://discord.com/channels/822931925618524240/1314956272776384594) (#"Debate Chamber").

**2.2.** In addition to Councilors, the following groups also have access to the Council channels: the Server Staff (<@&1414295576878649374>), Night Guards (<@&909364493405020180>), the Council of Sages (<@&911539477921562674>), Ambassadors (<@&972961071444922378>, see 3.2.4.), Temporary Councilors (<@&1415515056413741171>, see 3.5.), and server boosters (<@&833793553032413266>).

**2.3.** In the decision-making process and work organization, Councilors use appropriate tools, including: text discussions, voice discussions, voting, and the task board. A Councilor's responsibilities include actively using the designated tools, including participating in discussions and votes, and regularly updating their row on the task board.

**2.4.** Text discussions take place in the #rada-serwera channel. Their purpose, among other things, is to present a certain thought and persuade other councilors to accept it, propose an idea, or explain a problem and gather potential solutions.

**2.5.** Voice discussions (__tea parties__) are periodic conversations between the Server Council and Staff on current issues, organized primarily at the initiative of the Chairperson in the #"Sala Plenarna" voice channel. The date of the tea party is always determined in advance through an informal vote among potential participants.

**2.6.** Votes are conducted in the #sala-kolumnowa channel by the Chairperson or a Staff member. Only votes from those with the rank of <@&940690420327923743> matter, unless the poll creator decides otherwise. Others may indicate their opinion, but this does not affect the result. The Chairperson may remove such votes for better transparency.

**2.7.** The task board (Bobromiro) is an online to-do list for the Council and Staff, where progress regarding ideas and server projects is reported. The link to Bobromiro can be found in the pinned message in the #rada-serwera channel.
